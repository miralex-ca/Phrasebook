 The score is calculated as follows: +1 point for each correct response, -1 for each incorrect response. The highest score is 4 points.
 Items statuses include:<br><br>
 - 0 points: <i>Unknown</i> <br>
 - 1-2 points: <i>Familiar</i> (highlighted with blue)<br>
 - 3-4 points: <i>Mastered</i> (highlighted with green) <br><br>
 If an item gets the highest score (4 points), errors count will be reset back to 0.

<b class="section">Export/Import</b>
<p>
You can export your data and have a copy of it safely stored in case you change phone or you need to reset it. This will take a snapshot of your current data and export it as a file. This will allow to restore (import) your data from this backup file in the future. Note that this will remove all the current data and replace it by the new import, so make sure this is what you want before proceeding. You can find this feature on the Settings page.
